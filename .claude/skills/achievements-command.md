    "popularity": 85,
    "genres": ["genre1", "genre2"]

## Common Modifications

### Adjusting Achievement Thresholds

**Growth Achievements** (Line ~50-80):
```javascript
const growthAchievements = [
  { name: 'Rising Star', threshold: 1000, emoji: 'ðŸŒŸ' },
  { name: 'Gaining Traction', threshold: 5000, emoji: 'ðŸš€' },
  // Modify threshold values to adjust difficulty
];
```

**Viral Achievements** (Line ~82-95):
```javascript
const viralAchievements = [
  { name: 'Viral Moment', threshold: 500, emoji: 'ðŸ’¥' },
  // Adjust daily growth thresholds here
];
```

**Consistency Achievements** (Line ~97-110):
```javascript
const consistencyAchievements = [
  { name: 'Consistent Growth', days: 7, emoji: 'ðŸ“ˆ' },
  // Modify consecutive day requirements
];
```

### Adding New Achievement Categories

1. Create achievement array in `checkAchievements()` function
2. Add checking logic function (e.g., `checkNewCategory()`)
3. Update embed to include new category section
4. Add progress calculation for locked achievements

### Modifying Historical Data Window

Change the 90-day lookback period (Line ~120):
```javascript
const daysToCheck = 90; // Modify to analyze different time periods
```

### Customizing Progress Display

Adjust progress bar visualization (Line ~200-220):
```javascript
const progressBar = 'â–ˆ'.repeat(filled) + 'â–‘'.repeat(empty);
// Modify characters or length for different visual style
```

## Achievement Checking Functions

### `checkGrowthAchievements(stats)`
- Compares current Spotify followers against thresholds
- Returns unlocked growth milestones

### `checkViralMoments(history)`
- Analyzes day-over-day follower changes
- Detects single-day growth spikes
- Returns date of viral achievement unlock

### `checkConsistency(history)`
- Tracks consecutive days of positive growth
- Identifies longest growth streak
- Returns consistency achievement details

### `checkCollectiveAchievements(stats)`
- YouTube subscriber milestones
- Casa 24 collective-specific achievements

### `checkRareAchievements(stats)`
- Special cross-platform achievements
- Requires multiple criteria (e.g., Triple Threat)
- Genre-based achievements from Spotify data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No achievements data available"
**Cause**: Missing historical data files
**Solution**:
- Verify `data/history/` directory contains JSON files
- Check that tracking script is running daily
- Minimum 1 day of data required, 90 days for full functionality

### Issue: Achievements not unlocking despite meeting criteria
**Cause**: Data sync lag or incorrect stats
**Solution**:
- Check `artists.json` has current stats
- Verify historical files have complete data (no null values)
- Run data validation: Look for missing fields in artist object

### Issue: Autocomplete not showing artists
**Cause**: Case sensitivity or artist not in database
**Solution**:
- Verify artist exists in `artists.json`
- Check artist has `name` field properly set
- Autocomplete is case-insensitive but requires exact name match

### Issue: Progress percentage incorrect
**Cause**: Edge case in calculation logic
**Solution**:
- Check for achievements with multiple thresholds
- Verify historical data completeness for streak-based achievements
- For rare achievements, ensure all required fields exist

### Issue: Unlock dates showing wrong timestamp
**Cause**: Historical data missing for actual unlock date
**Solution**:
- Achievement unlock date = first day threshold was met in history
- If historical data incomplete, shows earliest available date
- Add retroactive historical data if needed

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Loads 90 days of historical files (can be 90+ file reads)
- Consider caching history data for multiple commands
- Current approach: Load on demand per artist

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Cache historical data**: Load once per bot session
2. **Index achievements**: Pre-calculate unlocks on data update
3. **Lazy loading**: Only load history if checking locked achievements
4. **Database migration**: Move to SQLite for faster queries
