```

### Growth Percentage
```javascript
growthPercent = (spotifyGrowth / prevSpotifyFollowers) * 100
```

### Star Rating Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateRating(totalGrowth, growthPercent) {
  let rating = 0;

  // Absolute growth points
  if (totalGrowth > 100) rating += 2;
  else if (totalGrowth > 50) rating += 1.5;
  else if (totalGrowth > 20) rating += 1;
  else if (totalGrowth > 0) rating += 0.5;

  // Percentage growth points
  if (growthPercent > 20) rating += 2;
  else if (growthPercent > 10) rating += 1.5;
  else if (growthPercent > 5) rating += 1;
  else if (growthPercent > 0) rating += 0.5;

  return Math.min(5, Math.ceil(rating));  // Max 5 stars
}
```

## Week Rating System

### Overall Performance Rating

## Data Format Requirements

### Artist Data Structure
Each historical snapshot needs:
```json
{
  "date": "2025-10-21",
  "artists": [
    {
      "name": "Artist Name",
      "spotify": {
        "followers": 1234,
        "monthly_listeners": "5678"
      },
      "youtube": {
        "subscribers": 123,
        "total_views": 45678,
        "top_videos": [
          { "title": "Video Title", "views": 1234 }
        ]
      },
      "instagram": {
        "followers": 456
      }
    }
  ],
  "discord": {
    "member_count": 123
  }
}
```

## Tree-Style Formatting

### Branch Characters
```
‚îú‚îÄ  Branch (middle item)
‚îî‚îÄ  End branch (last item)
```

### Example Output
```
Total Growth This Week
‚îú‚îÄ üéµ Spotify: +45 followers (12.3%) üìà
‚îú‚îÄ üéß Listeners: +123 (8.5%) üìà
‚îú‚îÄ üì∫ YouTube: +5 subs (4.2%) üìà
‚îú‚îÄ üëÅÔ∏è Views: +1,234 views
‚îú‚îÄ üì∏ Instagram: +12 followers (3.1%) üìà
‚îî‚îÄ üí¨ Discord: +3 members
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not enough data for weekly analysis"
**Cause**: Less than 8 days of historical data
**Solution**: Wait for more data collection to reach minimum threshold

### Issue: Week dates seem incorrect
**Cause**: Week calculation offset error
**Solution**: Verify weekStartIndex and weekEndIndex calculations

### Issue: Artists missing from report
**Cause**: Artist not present in both start and end data
**Solution**: Check if artist was added mid-week (skip comparison)

### Issue: Achievement detection not working
**Cause**: Thresholds too high or data issues
**Solution**:
- Lower thresholds
- Check data quality for week
- Verify growth calculations

### Issue: Top content showing old videos
**Cause**: View count may not have updated
**Solution**: Check data collection frequency

### Issue: Star ratings all same
**Cause**: Similar growth patterns across artists
**Solution**: Working as intended - adjust thresholds if needed

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: High Performer
```
Artist: "Chef Lino"
Spotify Growth: +67 followers (22% growth)
YouTube Growth: +12 subscribers
Instagram Growth: +8 followers
Total Growth: 87 followers

Star Rating Calculation:
- Total >50: +1.5 points
- Percent >20%: +2 points
- Total: 3.5 ‚Üí rounds to 4 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

### Example 2: Moderate Performer
```
Artist: "PYRO"
Spotify Growth: +23 followers (7% growth)
YouTube Growth: +3 subscribers
Instagram Growth: +2 followers
Total Growth: 28 followers

Star Rating Calculation:
- Total >20: +1 point
- Percent >5%: +1 point
- Total: 2 ‚Üí 2 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

## Performance Optimization
- Report generation is O(n) where n = number of artists
- Historical data loading most expensive operation
- Consider caching weekly reports (update once daily)
- Precompute on Monday mornings for consistency

## Optimization Tips
1. **Schedule Generation**: Auto-generate Monday 10 AM
2. **Cache Reports**: Store generated reports for 7 days
3. **Parallel Processing**: Calculate artist stats in parallel
4. **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculate if new data available
5. **Notification System**: Alert for new weekly report
6. **Export Options**: PDF/image export for sharing
7. **Historical Comparison**: Compare to same week last month/year

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-week trend analysis (4-week moving average)
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Weekly goals and target tracking
- Predictive next week forecast
- Automated social media posting
- Executive summary mode
- Detailed artist deep-dives
- Custom week ranges (not just 7 days)
- Week-to-week momentum tracking
- Seasonal adjustment (account for trends)
- Competitive analysis (vs. industry benchmarks)
- Visual charts and graphs
- Email digest version
- Weekly highlights video generation
- Integration with project management tools
