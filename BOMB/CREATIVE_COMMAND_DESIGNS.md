## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Technical Requirements:
1. All commands use Discord.js EmbedBuilder for rich formatting
2. Commands pull from existing data structure (168 days of historical data)
3. Use existing utility functions from `/bot/utils/analytics.js`
4. Leverage `/bot/utils/dataLoader.js` for data access
5. Fixed-width formatting for ASCII art (use code blocks)

### Design Principles:
- **Visual First**: Every command creates a screenshot-worthy output
- **Narrative Driven**: Data tells a story, not just numbers
- **Actionable**: Insights lead to clear next steps
- **Shareable**: Formats that people want to show off
- **Emotionally Engaging**: Metaphors create connection
- **Varied Perspectives**: Different lenses on same data
- **Gamified Elements**: Competition, progress, achievements
- **Predictive Power**: Future-looking, not just historical

### Why These Work:
1. **Unique Visualizations**: Each uses a completely different metaphor
2. **Cross-Appeal**: Different commands appeal to different personality types
3. **Depth**: Can be simple or complex based on user engagement
4. **Replayability**: Users will run commands multiple times to see changes
5. **Social Proof**: Designed to be shared outside Discord
6. **Educational**: Users learn analytics through engaging formats
7. **Motivation**: Gamification drives continued engagement
8. **Community Building**: Many encourage artist collaboration

Each command transforms dry analytics into engaging visual stories that people actually want to interact with and share!
